# MSBA CAPSTONE - SWIRE COCA-COLA PREDICTIVE MODELING

## Business problem and Project Objective

Swire Coca-Cola, one of the largest Coca-Cola bottlers in the U.S., faces significant operational challenges due to unplanned machine downtimes across its six production plants, which annually produce approximately 192 million cases of beverages. Mechanical limitations, premature wear and tear, and unforeseen breakdowns result in only 94.4% of the required orders being fulfilled, leading to an estimated $60 million in annual losses. 

The inefficiency stems from a reactive maintenance strategy, where machines are repaired only after the failure, causing prolonged inactivity and increased costs. To bridge the output gap and reduce losses, Swire Coca-Cola needs a solid understanding of downtime patterns, their influence on productivity, and actionable insights for deploying maintenance solutions.

This project addresses the persistent problem of unplanned machine downtime at Swire Coca-Cola by using historical maintenance data to provide actionable insights and shift to a proactive maintenance approach. The project's goal is to improve equipment dependability and streamline production efficiency through analysing failure trends and downtime records. 

The key objectives include:
* Analyzing downtime trends and identifying high-cost functional nodes across six Swire Coca-Cola production plants.
* Pinpointing critical equipment and parts most susceptible to failure.
* Evaluating the impact of preventive maintenance on reducing downtime and operational disruptions.
* Delivering strategic recommendations to boost productivity, minimize costs, and enhance profitability.
